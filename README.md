# pomodorobot
This script implements a bot for a discord server, that enables multiple people to coordinate pomodoro breaks together.

In the off-chance that I or anyone else ever recycles this...
In order to use this script, create a .env file which looks like the following:
#.env
DISCORD_TOKEN=insert token
DISCORD_GUILD="insert name of discord server"

This tutorial has a good explanation on how to set up a bot in Discord's developer portal:
